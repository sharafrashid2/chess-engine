# Chess Engine

To run the game, simply download the directory, and from the root directory, run the main.py file and it will open the game in a window. 

This chess engine is able to find all legal moves for every board state and detect checkmates and stalemates. The engine also includes special moves, castling, en passes, and promotions. 
I am currently working on a chess AI that the user can play against.
